# GameOfLife
My implementation of Conway's Game of Life. Technical test for BBC Graduate Developer program.

To test the program you require NodeJS installed. Download/clone and navigate to the directory. To view the app either

1. Enter 'serve -s build' to run the build folder.
2. Install node_modules by entering 'npm install' then 'npm start' to test from source files.
