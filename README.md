# GameOfLife
My implementation of Conway's Game of Life. Technical test for BBC Graduate Developer program.

To test the program you require nodeJS installed. Download/clone and navigate to the directory. Options include

1. Enter 'serve -s build' to run the build folder.
2. Enter 'npm install' to add the node_modules and then 'npm start'.
